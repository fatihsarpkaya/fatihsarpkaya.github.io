Hi, I am Fatih! I am a second-year PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at [NYU WIRELESS](https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu), New York University, under the supervision of Professor Shivendra Panwar. My current research interest lie in TCP congestion control, low latency networking, and wireless communication.
